## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions. Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

## Additional Libraries

- Rails-related RubyGems (framework to create RESTful API)
- pg (a PostgreSQL Ruby gem) (local database)

## Code Snippet


```
 def create
    if User.find_by(username: params[:username])
      render json: {error: "Username has been taken"}
    else
      @user = User.create(user_params)
      if @user.valid? &&
        token = encode_token({user_id: @user.id})
        render json: {user: @user, token: token}
      else
        render json: {error: "Invalid username or password"}
      end
    end
 end
```

```
 def expenses_by_user
  #@budget = Budget.where({id: params[:budget_id], user: params[:user_id]})
  @user = User.find(params[:user_id])
  @user_expenses = @user.expenses
  render :json => {
    :response => "Here are all your expenses",
    :data => @user_expenses
  }
  end
```

## Issues and Resolutions


**ERROR**: Expenses not returning for user
**RESOLUTION**: `User.find`, not `Expense.find`

**ERROR**: All users able to see the same budget
**RESOLUTION**: Updated `belongs_to`, `has_many through` across all models

**ERROR**: Able to make multiple users with same username
**RESOLUTION**: Added `User.find_by(username: params[:username])` condition in create user controller
